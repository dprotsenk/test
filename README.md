# Automate EKS cluster setup on AWS


You've joined a new and growing startup.

The company wants to build its initial Kubernetes infrastructure on AWS.

They have asked you if you can help create the following:

Terraform code that deploys an EKS cluster (whatever latest version is currently available) into an existing VPC
The terraform code should also prepare anything needed for a pod to be able to assume an IAM role
Include a short readme that explains how to use the Terraform repo and that also demonstrates how an end-user (a developer from the company) can run a pod on this new EKS cluster and also have an IAM role assigned that allows that pod to access an S3 bucket.

## How to

1. Change directory to `stage_1`

2. Read `README.md` file.
